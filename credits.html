        <p class="definition">
          Dyscalculia is a learning disability in math. People with have trouble
          with math at many levels. They often struggle with key concepts like
          bigger vs. smaller. And they can have a hard time doing basic math
          problems and more abstract math.

          <h2>How to use Dyscalculator</h2>
          <p class="manual-text">
            Itâ€™s not certain that my girlfriend has this condition but the fact
            is that I often have to calculate something for her so let it be as
            if she has dyscalculia. This calculator is designed to calculate the
            average grade in college. For example, you have a subject that has 2
            colloquia and a project. Colloquia are 40% (first column) of the
            overall grade each and the project 20%. At the first colloquium, you
            get 90% (second column), which means that you have 90% of that 40%
            of the overall grade. Did you get it? No? Well fuck you and I hate
            you. &#60;3
